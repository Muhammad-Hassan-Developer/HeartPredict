# heart_prediction

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

# 🚀 Proud to share my first Flutter app – Heart Disease Prediction!
I’ve developed a Heart Disease Prediction App using Flutter, following a clean and scalable MVVM architecture and integrating Firebase Realtime Database for cloud storage.
🔍 Users can input their medical data to get an AI-based prediction on the likelihood of heart disease.
 ✅ The prediction is powered by a pretrained Machine Learning model that I hosted using a Flask API on Heroku — enabling real-time communication between the app and the model backend.
# 🧠 Key Highlights:
Flutter app with decent UI and MVVM pattern
Firebase integration for secure and real-time data storage
Flask API hosted on Heroku for ML model inference
Real-world health prediction with personalized results
# This project has been a big learning milestone — and I’m just getting started. 🚀
 Would love your thoughts and feedback!
